# Week 7 | Groceries Server on Heroku (Optional)

<p>I attempted to deploy the grocery application to Heroku by following the week 7 instruction video. However, the mLab add on is depreciated, and is no longer accessible to be used as a free host. The closest option is Open Rocket but, it only has paid tiers. </p>
